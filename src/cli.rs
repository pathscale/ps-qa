//! The command line, as a type.
//!
//! # Why this is not hand-rolled
//!
//! It was, and the cost showed up as bugs rather than as ugliness. Modes were
//! matched on `args[0]` and every parameter read by position through
//! `args.get(n)`, so a flag was indistinguishable from a positional: `qa rename
//! --toon` took `--toon` as the group name and reported "no check matching
//! Some(\"--toon\")" until the flag was filtered back out by hand at each site.
//! A mistyped flag was silently ignored rather than rejected, because nothing
//! ever looked at the arguments it did not expect.
//!
//! The help text had the same problem from the other side: a 73 line string
//! kept in step with the dispatch by hand, describing defaults that lived as
//! literals hundreds of lines away. It drifted, and there was no way to notice.
//!
//! Deriving both from one definition means the parse and the help cannot
//! disagree, and a default is written once where the reader can see it.
//!
//! # Diagnostics are flags, not environment variables
//!
//! `QA_TRACE=1` and `SWEEP_TRACE=1` used to gate tracing. An environment
//! variable is invisible in the command a person pastes into a bug report, does
//! not appear in `--help`, and cannot be validated. They are `--trace` now.
//!
//! # One output format
//!
//! TOON, always, rather than a column layout for a person and a machine format
//! behind a flag. Two formats mean two code paths through every reporting
//! function, gated on a boolean threaded down from the argument parser, and the
//! one nobody runs is the one that rots. TOON is readable enough to keep as the
//! only answer: a uniform array declares its fields once and spends a line per
//! row, which is the shape a column layout was approximating anyway, without
//! losing any field that happens to contain a space.
