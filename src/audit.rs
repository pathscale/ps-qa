//! Every button in the running application, measured.
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! The owner reported broken controls one at a time for a week, and each report
//! was a thing no test could see. The reason is that the checks available were
//! all *synthetic*: rendering a component in isolation says the component can
//! work, never that the button in the window does. An icon rendered alone drew
//! perfectly while fifteen of them in a real panel shared one DOM node and left
//! fourteen empty, and nothing but a person looking at the window caught it.
//!
//! So this does not render anything. It walks the semantic tree of the running
//! application, takes every button in it, and asks the renderer what each one
//! actually put on screen. There is no fixture, no mock and no isolated mount:
//! the subject is the app a person is looking at.
//!
//! # What it can and cannot say
//!
//! It reports what a control *shows*. A button with no ink is one a person
//! cannot see, which is the failure that kept shipping. It deliberately does
//! not click anything: `Delete` and `Close` are destructive, and an audit that
//! mutates the user's data to prove a button works is worse than the bug.
//! Behaviour under click belongs in `qa`, against a throwaway profile.
//!
//! ```sh
//! cargo run -q -p ps-qa -- audit          # every button
//! cargo run -q -p ps-qa -- audit close    # one family
//! ```
