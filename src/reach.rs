//! Getting a control on screen before judging it.
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! A sweep that plans from one snapshot of whatever surface the application
//! happened to open on, and drops any button whose box is `0x0`, measures a
//! fraction of the window and says nothing about the rest. Against a real
//! application that is not a detail: in the run that motivated this module,
//! 286 buttons were in the tree, 64 had a box, and 222 were quietly discarded.
//! None of the 222 were hidden. They were the per-row controls, on a surface
//! the sweep never visited.
//!
//! A skip is indistinguishable from a pass in the output, so a run that touched
//! a fifth of the window reported "every button acted". That is the whole bug.
//! Coverage was one screen deep and the report did not say so.
//!
//! # What this does instead
//!
//! Reaching is a first-class step with its own verdict. Before a control is
//! judged it is *brought into view*: its surface is opened, its section is
//! expanded, its row is hovered, and it is scrolled to. Only then is it clicked.
//! If none of that gives it a box it is counted as *unreachable* and printed,
//! rather than dropped, because a control the harness cannot reach is either a
//! real defect or a gap in this file, and both need to be visible.
//!
//! The rule the whole module turns on: **never silently skip.** Every button in
//! the tree ends in exactly one bucket, and the buckets are printed.
