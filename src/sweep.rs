//! Click every button and check that it did what it says.
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! The audit next door measures what a control *shows*. That is not what a
//! button is for. A `Delete` that paints perfectly and deletes nothing is a
//! working picture of a broken feature, and a user asked, correctly and more
//! than once, for the thing that presses them.
//!
//! So this presses them. Run it against an application-configured throwaway
//! profile so destructive controls cannot affect real data; profile setup is
//! owned by the application, not this harness.
//!
//! # What an expectation is
//!
//! Every button claims something in its accessible name. `Collapse Records` says
//! a section will collapse; `Delete X` says a row will disappear; `Close X` says
//! a tab will go. Each of those is a statement about the tree *after* the click,
//! and the tree is readable, so each is checkable without knowing anything about
//! the application's internals.
//!
//! The check is deliberately shallow and mechanical: does the control's own
//! promise hold. It does not know what a project is, and it does not need to.
//! That is what lets one rule cover forty buttons and keep covering them when
//! forty-one appear.
