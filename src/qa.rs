//! What a check is, and what its verdict means.
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! A DOM-only test environment answers questions about a tree the user never
//! sees. It has no compositor, no hit-testing and no layout, so it reports a
//! node as fine while the screen shows nothing. A green suite over jsdom says
//! the code is self-consistent, not that the interface works.
//!
//! Two failure classes make the point, and both have shipped past a green unit
//! suite in a real application:
//!
//! - **Artwork that lays out and does not draw.** The semantic tree reports a
//!   node whether or not a pixel was painted, and a node can have a correct box
//!   and a correct stroke colour while drawing nothing at all. A renderer that
//!   parses each inline `<svg>` from that element's markup alone will resolve a
//!   reference into a shared sprite to nothing. jsdom cannot see this: its
//!   `<svg>` is a well-behaved object that never goes near a rasteriser.
//! - **Controls that only exist while hovered.** A test that never moves a
//!   pointer cannot see them at all.
//!
//! # What a check is
//!
//! A [`Check`] is a precondition, an action, and an assertion about the state
//! after it, all expressed against the running application. Every part is
//! observed rather than assumed, and [`Paints`](Expect::Paints) fails if the
//! element is in the tree with no box - which is the thing the semantic tree
//! alone will not tell you.
//!
//! Checks are data, and they belong to the application under test rather than
//! to this crate. See [`checks`] for where they are read from.
//!
//! ```sh
//! ps-qa qa           # every check
//! ps-qa qa icons     # one group
//! ```
